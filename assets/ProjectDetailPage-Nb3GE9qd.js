Before, finalizing a recruitment profile meant first sorting out data requirements (e.g., high-precision medical data annotation vs. general text annotation), then working backwards to define experts’ professional backgrounds, years of experience, and skill requirements – while considering recruitment feasibility via suppliers and external organizations. It often took multiple revisions. Now, I tell AI the data needs: "Recruit experts for tumor medical image annotation, for model training data. They must accurately identify lesion locations and distinguish pathological types; recruitment via external organizations."
