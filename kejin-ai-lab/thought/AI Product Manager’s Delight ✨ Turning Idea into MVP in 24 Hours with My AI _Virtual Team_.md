# AI Product Manager’s Delight ✨ Turning Idea into MVP in 24 Hours with My AI "Virtual Team"

Who feels me, fellow PMs? As an AI product manager drained daily by weekly reports, prototypes, and AI news roundups, I had a late-night epiphany while slacking off: I play with AI every day—why not build an "productivity plug-in" for myself with AI? 💡 So I decided to go all in, challenging myself to turn the idea of "AI auto-organizing weekly reports + scheduled summary reminders" into a demo on my personal website in 24 hours. The process was like hitting fast-forward, thrilling yet full of small pitfalls. I’ve compiled this note for like-minded PMs to copy!

## 🌅 Hours 0-4: Pain Points Spark Ideas, Refining Vagueness into Clarity

It all started with a breakdown last Wednesday: pressed by my boss for a weekly report before off work, I scrambled through chat records and documents to piece it together, tweaking the format repeatedly. I wanted to post a weekly AI news collection but forgot to save the industry updates. At that moment, one thought popped into my head: AI must take over these "repetitive tasks"! 🤯

No lengthy requirement documents—first, I listed 3 core goals based on the pain points: scheduled summary reminders, weekly reports generated in my fixed format, and real-time AI hot topic scraping. Then I roped in Doubao as my "brainstorming buddy," firing off questions after sharing the idea: "Will this reminder logic disrupt work?" "How to make AI accurately recognize my weekly report template?" Doubao always filled in the details I missed, like "Link with calendar for flexible reminder times."

A big shoutout to ByteDance’s internal **Chujian** Coding Agent! As a code-savvy "tech buddy," I directly tossed it: "Help me analyze the technical feasibility of this requirement—any low-cost implementation plans?" It instantly replied with core ideas: lightweight APIs for reminders, Prompt accuracy for weekly report generation, and public news APIs for hot topic scraping. It turned vague ideas into actionable directions in seconds, saving me the hassle of negotiating with developers.

## 🌞 Hours 4-10: Prompt Optimization is Key—Translating "Ideas" into "AI-Understandable Language"

I used to think "AI is useless," but later realized 90% of the issue was poorly written Prompts. For this step, I headed straight to **Prompt Pilot**, iterating the rough initial instruction "Help me write a weekly report" into a structured Prompt: "You’re my dedicated weekly report assistant. Based on the work snippets I provide, generate a report in the following format (template attached). Keep it concise, data-focused, no fabrications—prompt for missing info if incomplete." 📝

I tested and adjusted it over a dozen times on the platform, focusing on two optimizations: first, explicitly banning fabrications to prevent AI from making up work content; second, attaching my real weekly report template to align AI with my formatting habits. After tweaks, content accuracy jumped from 60% to 90%, cutting down massive revision time. Don’t skip this step—a good Prompt is like an "AI commander," smoothing the subsequent development process.

## 🌆 Hours 10-20: AI Writes PRD + Code, I Play the "Hands-Off Manager" Tracking Progress

With the Prompt optimized, I dumped the requirements, structured instructions, and technical ideas to **Trae**. Who knew? It generated a logically sound PRD in an hour, marked core feature priorities, and even proactively asked: "Do you want to simplify the interaction prototype to prioritize core functions?" 🤖

Then came the magic: Trae started coding simultaneously, handling everything from front-end interactions (reminder pop-ups, weekly report generation pages) to back-end logic (data storage, API calls). It updated progress midway: "Hot topic scraping API tested—supports custom keyword filtering." I only needed to occasionally confirm interaction effects, like "Can the reminder pop-up be floating to avoid blocking work pages?" No code written by me—purely "product-led, AI-executed."

A quick optimization tip here: Let Trae enable auto-deployment after syncing code to GitHub, eliminating manual uploads. I forgot this and wasted half an hour—lesson learned the hard way!

## 🌙 Hours 20-24: User Testing + Rapid Iteration—MVP is a Starting Line, Not a Finish Line

At 2 AM, the first demo went live! I immediately sent the link to 3 user groups: fellow PMs (demand understanding), dev colleagues (stability check), and non-Internet friends (usability test). Feedback rolled in fast and precise: PMs suggested "adding custom fields to the weekly report template," devs pointed out "occasional lag in hot topic scraping—need loading animations," and friends complained "fixed reminder times—can we avoid meeting slots?" 📊

Based on feedback, I had Trae iterate quickly in the final 2 hours: adding custom fields, supplementing loading animations, and optimizing reminder rules (linking with calendar to avoid busy times). By 4 AM, the final MVP was securely hosted on my personal website—it not only showcases my AI coding skills but also solves real work pain points. That "from 0 to 1" sense of achievement beats writing 10 weekly reports! 

## 💡 Proven Process Optimization Tips

1. Idea Phase: Brainstorm with both a "product buddy" (Doubao) and a "tech buddy" (Chujian) to avoid technically unfeasible requirements and save back-and-forth time.

2. Prompt Phase: Organize frequently used templates into a "Prompt Library" (manage Prompts like code) for quick reuse—doubling efficiency.

3. Development Phase: Ask Trae to prioritize "core functions + minimal interactions." MVPs don’t need perfection—launch first to validate demand, then iterate based on feedback.

4. Testing Phase: Involve users of different roles, especially non-professionals—they’ll spot usability issues you miss.

Now my personal website has several such AI demos—they’re not just work achievement records, but also "hard currency" for communicating with peers. As AI product managers, we don’t need to master coding, but we must learn to "direct AI to work." Mastering these tools lets us achieve efficient "one-person team" execution. 🚀
